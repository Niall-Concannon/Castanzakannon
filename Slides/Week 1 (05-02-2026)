What have we done ? 

-- So far our team has looked at the project idea mainly exploring different potential projects and what coding languages we may use.

-- We also created a schedule to meet twice a week every week ouside of class hours to quickly go over what the each of us is doing and brainstorm.

What are we going to do ?

-- Soon we are going to start work on the basics of the code and trying to narrow down the overall skeleton and framework of the game.

-- The team also needs to come up with a suitable game name and also expand on our original idea of a rougelite game.

Problems we faced

-- We are stuck between choosing a few different languages like C# for a moblie app but the simplicity of using Javascript and allowing anyone to 
quickly play using a browser is very exciting.
